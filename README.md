# ECD106-Digital_Systems_Designer


[Live Preview Link](https://cshames1.github.io/ECD106/)

 Ready for Testing:
 
  -RTL Implementation
      
      -.v files can be imported from DSD
      
      -the bit width of the modules inputs is accounted for
      
      -if any imported components are used in the schematic, .v files with renamed modules will be exported with the top level .v file
      
  -Bus Implementation
  
      -fanIn and fanOuts added
      
      -bus inputports and outputports added
      
      -registers and muxes adjust their output bitwidth according to their inputs
      
      -edges thickness scales in relation to bit width

 TODO
  
  -progress on the simulation capability
